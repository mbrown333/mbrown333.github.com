Dijkstra</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Pure Functions</h2>\\n<p>A pure function has no side effects.  So for each input a pure function will give you the exact same result every time.  </p>\\n<p>The benefit of using pure functions is that they are typically easier to debug as they are predictable in their outcome and simple to read.</p>\\n<p>Examples of side effects are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>an xhr call</li>\\n<li>changing a variable outside of the function’s scope</li>\\n<li>console log</li>\\n<li>outputting to a file</li>\\n<li>calling other functions with side effects</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Let’s take a look at an example of a function with side effects:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const a = 1;\\nconst a1 = () =&gt; a += 1;\\na1(); \\nconsole.log(a); // 2\\na1();\\nconsole.log(a); // 3</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The result of this function will give you a different result each time as every time it is called it continues to increment a because it’s operating on a variable that is not an input to itself.</p>\\n<p>Let’s change our example to a pure function.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const b = 1;\\nconst b1 = (val) =&gt; val += 1;\\nconsole.log(b1(b)); // 2\\nconsole.log(b1(b)); // 2</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>In this case <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">b1</code> will give you the same result every time for any given input you pass into it unlike <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">a1</code> which mutates a variable outside of its own scope.  <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">b1</code> only operates on the variable that it takes in as an input.</p>\\n<h2>Higher Order Functions</h2>\\n<p>Higher order functions are functions that can accept another function as a parameter or return another function as a result.  This is how functional programming achieves reusability with a set of reusable utility functions as opposed to <em>Object Oriented Programming</em> which locates functions and data together in classes.</p>\\n<p>Higher order functions are possible in javascript because it has <em>first class functions</em>.  Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions, assigned to variables, and returned from other functions.</p>\\n<p>The array methods <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">map</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">reduce</code>, and <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">filter</code> are examples of extremely useful and reusable higher order functions.  Once you learn to use these array methods it totally changes the way you write code, because they are fantastic.</p>\\n<p>Let’s  demonstrate what a simple higher order function looks like:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const doubleArray = (a) =&gt; a.map(i =&gt; i * 2);\\nconst reverseArray = (b) =&gt; b.reverse();\\n\\nconst compose = (a, b) =&gt; (input) =&gt; b(a(input));\\n\\nconst input = [1, 2, 3];\\nconsole.log(compose(doubleArray, reverseArray)(input)); // [6, 4, 2]</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Here we define a couple of functions to operate on arrays.  The <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">compose</code> functions allow us to combine these two operations and gives us a function as a result.  We then can call that resulting function and pass in our <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">input</code> array.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. — C.A.R. Hoare, The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Functional Composition</h2>\\n<p>Functional composition is combining or chaining simple functions to make up more complex functions.  Again, since Javascript has first class functions it makes it easy to apply functions to the results of other functions.</p>\\n<p>This can be demonstrated using the array map, reduce, and filter methods by chaining them together:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const list = [1, 2, 6, 8];\\n\\nconst result = list.map(a =&gt; a * 3)\\n  .filter(b =&gt; b &gt; 3)\\n  .reduce((sum, c) =&gt; {\\n    sum += c;\\n    return sum;\\n  });\\n\\nconsole.log(result); // 48</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The result of each function returns a new array and we call the next function in the chain on that resulting array.</p>\\n<p>Let’s go over another example where we combine two simple functions into a single function.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-text\\\"><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">const triple = (a) =&gt; a * 3;\\nconst minus2 = (b) =&gt; b - 2;\\n\\nconst tripleMinus2 = (c) =&gt; triple(minus2(c));\\n\\nconsole.log(tripleMinus2(5)); // 9\\nconsole.log(tripleMinus2(45)); // 129\\nconsole.log(tripleMinus2(678)); // 2028</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>These are trivial examples obviously, but in my experience organizing your code into small utility functions makes them easy to reuse and combine with other utility functions.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The object-oriented version of spaghetti code is, of course, ‘lasagna code’.
